# Differences

mieru comes with a slew of features and changes from shadcn/ui. 

## Design

The most distinguishable feature of mieru is its unique design. The design of mieru's components experiences a complete departure from shadcn/ui's design, focusing on a more playful and feedback-driven approach.

## Source of truth

One of the most notable benefits of shadcn/ui is ease of use for styling its components. All components are able to be fully customized using Tailwind CSS. However, one drawback of this is that it can be a chore to edit the overall design system. You would need to edit each component's styles and keep track of which components use which styles.

mieru components reference a single `styles.ts` file, which contains the fundamental styles for different component categories. This allows for a single source of truth for the design system, making it trivial to maintain and update.

The majority of mieru components can be classified as either "static" or "interactive". Two other, more specific categories include "popover" and "overlay".

{/* - **Static**: Elements whose style do not change when interacting with them. Examples being cards, alerts, and badges */}

### Static

Components whose style do not change when interacting with them. Examples being cards, alerts, and badges

<StaticExamples/>

### Interactive

Components whose style change when interacting with them. Examples being buttons, checkboxes, and switches

<InteractiveExamples/>

### Popover

Styles for any component that contains a popover (or similar). Examples being dropdowns, hover cards, and navigation menus.

### Overlay

Styles for any component that contains an overlay. Currently only dialogs and alert dialogs.

## Unrestricted icons

shadcn/ui components utilize the [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) icon library, which provides a beautiful and extensive set of icons in the form of React components. However, this icon library locks you into using their own components, which is limiting.

mieru components utilize the [Iconify](https://iconify.design/) library, which is an excellent solution for using icons in your codebase without vendor lock-in.
