mieru comes with a slew of features and changes from shadcn/ui. 

## Design

The most distinguishable feature of mieru is its unique design. The design of mieru's components experiences a complete departure from shadcn/ui's design, focusing on a more playful and feedback-driven approach.

## Source of truth

One of the most notable benefits of shadcn/ui is ease of use for styling its components. All components are individually styled, allowing them to be fully customized. However, one drawback of this is that it can be a chore to edit the overall design system. You would need to edit each component's styles and keep track of which components use which styles.

mieru components reference a single `styles.ts` file, which contains the fundamental styles for different component categories. This allows for a single source of truth for the design system, making it trivial to maintain and update.

The majority of mieru components can be classified as either "static" or "interactive".
